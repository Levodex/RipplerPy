## Install notes

* Make sure you have MongoDb set-up before running
* Install all additional wheels/eggs using WinPython before proceeding
* Give admin level access if you want Rippler running on http/https
      # Https mode is scheduled for the next release


## Release notes

* Do **NOT** package production builds with the zLib binaries present in the folder
    # This is a breaking change and on the TODO list: zLib code hasn't been merged in the project
    # And since base rippler was made in just 3 days it was left out for future versions
    # Use a portable zLib executable in the Ripple base directory/Install it on the side for your builds

* Secure Journalling is currently experimental and still in development
    # disable journalling before you package a production build


## Docs

Sadly I don't have enough time to write the docs right now but it is on the listed TODOs.
The code is pretty straightforward I think but if you want some brief detailing feel free to contact me and I'll explain :)
