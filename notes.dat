==== Notes for Bootstrap ====
==== 06/30/2017 ====
	==== Basic ====
		Bootstrap works through grids.
		Total 12 columns exist for large viewports.
		basically everything is a table of grids.
		lowest resolution device settings is the default
	==== Grid system ====
		Rows must be placed within a .container class for proper alignment and padding.
		Content should be placed within the columns, and only columns may be the immediate children of rows.
		Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding.
		Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span.
		
		For example, three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4.
			Container grid class to use = 12 / number of columns to use
			So for 4 required columns we use 4 .col-xs-3,
			For 6 required columns we use 6 .col-xs-2
		And so on
	==== Media query ====
		Conditional css is called media query
		Media Queries in Bootstrap allow you to move, show and hide content based on the viewport size.
		media query has the syntax:
			@media (query1) and (query2) and ...
		Example
			@media (min-width: @screen-sm-min) and (max-width: @screen-sm-max)
	==== Grid system specifics ====
		The four display classes have Class prefixes
			.col-xs-
			.col-sm-
			.col-md-
			.col-lg-
		followed by column specifier
		The column sum always needs to be 12 which can be made any possible way
		Illustration for multiple specifiers:
			<div class = "col-sm-3 col-md-6 col-lg-4">....</div>
			<div class = "col-sm-9 col-md-6 col-lg-8">....</div>
		will render
			25%, 75% on small
			50 - 50 on mid
			33 - 66 on large
		displays
		so,
			col-XX-Y
		means
			XX - viewport for xs, sm, md, lg
			Y - Yth fraction of 12 giving Y/12% width value
	==== hiding, visibility & clearfix ====
		hidden-XX will render
			element hidden on viewport's display
		visible-XX will render
			element visible on viewport's display
		Column clearance issue may be present with multiple viewport tiers
			(One column may be taller than the other)
		To fix that, use a combination of a class .clearfix and the visible/hidden classes
==== 07/01/2017 ====
	==== offsets ====
		An example
			col-md-offset-3
		where
			col-XX-offset-Y
		gives an empty offset column on XX viewport and Y number of empty columns
	==== Nesting columns ====
		To nest your content with the default grid, add a new .row div
		and a set of .col-md-* columns within an existing .col-md-* column.
		Nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to 12.
	==== Ordering ====
		You can easily change the order of built-in grid columns with .col-md-push-* and .col-md-pull-* classes
			where * range from 1 to 11.
